# matrix

implementatioon of a matrix with complex number elements

and the basic operations 

  1. addition
  2. difference
  3. multioplication (a matrix or a number)
  4. determinant (due to rounding it doesn`t gives little error)
  5. matrix inversev (only for invertable )
  6. adjugate
  7. transpose
  8. solving equations (Ax = b for square matrices)
